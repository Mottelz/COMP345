# Conquest: A Risk Rip Off Written for College Credit
#### by Felix, Melodie, Mottel, & Vickle

This is a project written in C++ by four poor overworked college students. Hopefully it works and doesn't bore you to tears. 

## For Marker of assignment 2
If you run make this will compile six seperate programs, one for each part. They will be named with a digit corresponding to their part (e.g. assignment 2 part 1 will compile as 1). The makefile uses g++ commands. 

Below is a list of driver for each part. A complete list of files used can be found in the makefile.  
Part 1: GameInitDriver.cpp
Part 2: StartupDriver.cpp
Part 3: GameLoopDriver.cpp
Part 4: ReinforceDriver.cpp
Part 5: AttackDriver.cpp
Part 6: FortificationDriver.cpp
